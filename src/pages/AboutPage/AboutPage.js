              Like many, my humble beginnings lie in the worlds of Geocities, Angelfire and Tripod; coding for fun by hand in NotePad (WordPad introduced hidden characters!) and the mid-90s but have grown and expanded into the modern landscape of robustly-featured applications as the web did.

              Currently, my favorite language is <span className="highlight">JavaScript</span> and I love everything having to do with the open source community. Lately, I've mostly been writing JavaScript (ES6) with React and Redux and experimenting with PWA concepts.

            <p>In my professional career I've developed a diverse array of both consumer and business facing applications including the online <span className="highlight">NiKEiD Creator</span>, <span className="highlight">Groupon</span>'s web, email and internal tool platforms, implemented the redesigned <span className="highlight">US Dept of Education FAFSA Portal</span> with Accenture and promotional and interactive websites, games and apps for Fortune 500 companies including HP, Motorola, TD Ameritrade, Burger King, Land Rover, GE, GM, Walgreen's, Johnnie Walker, United and AARP while at <span className="highlight">DesignKitchen</span>.

              In addition this plethroa of overwhelmingly diverse subjects I also enjoy reading, listening to music, collecting sneakers, comedy, live music, fishing, hiking, camping, playing hockey and basketball (<a href="https://fastmodelsports.com/" className="about-link" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">professionally</a>), taking pictures of my cat <a href="http://instagram.com/bdkay" className="about-link" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Simon</a>üê± and watching orange and brown ball sports. I also love Seinfeld, 90s action movies (especially Van Damme and Seagal) and anything having to do with time travel or personally incomprehensible scientific subjects.

            <p>The English major side of my brain and the Engineering side are locked in a persistent, eternal war over the Oxford comma's logical usage versus always staying DRY.
